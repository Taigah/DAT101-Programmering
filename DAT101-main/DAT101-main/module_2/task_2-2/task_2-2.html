      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Constant should be used when the variable is not going to be changed later on. Let and Var variables can be used otherwise. They can't all be constant since they serve different purposes.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				In VScode it won't affect the outcome of the expression as the program will notice still calculate the right answer, but other programs might not so it's best to include them regardless as standard procedure. It will also be easier for other people to read the expression.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We use the command parseFloat(variable.toFixed(number))
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We could make a variable comparing the two with the == signs and then printOut to see if the statement is true.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				They return a statement true or false about a variable. We can check by doing printOut and then the variable name
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				This function gives us a random number in the range we put inside the parenthesis. It can be used for giving a random answer to something.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus is an arithmetic operator that gives us the remainder left after dividing.

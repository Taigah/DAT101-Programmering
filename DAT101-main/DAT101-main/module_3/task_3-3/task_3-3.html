      <li>1. What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?
        2. Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.
        3. What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?
        4. How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?
        5. Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.
        6. Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.
        7. Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
      <p>1. Creating a function means defining or declaring it. Invoking a function means means executing it in your code at a specific point.
        2. Semicolons are used to end a statement or line of code, but are mostly optional nowadays. It is still good pratice to do.
        Code blocks are a group of statements wrapped in curly brackets. They are used to define the scope of control structures. You use them to group multiple statements together which should be exectued as a unit.
        3. The result is "undefined". Because the function doesn't have a value it will not be usable in other code.
        4. We put them all inside parantheses and seperate them by commas.
        5. They are placeholders in the function definition that hold the values used when invocating the function.
        6. Because Javascript does not automatically assign any value to parameters, instead setting their default value to undefined.
        7. A recursive function is a function that calls itself to solve a problem in smaller subproblems, typically using a base case to stop the recursion. If a proper base case is not used it may lead to stack overflow.

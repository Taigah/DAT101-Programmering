      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      wdwd
      <p>If the wake-up time is exactly 7 the sentence will print onto the site like normal, but if it is anything other than 7 it will print nothing.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Since the first part is already checking for wake-up time 7, if it's 7 then it will only print out the first sentence. If it is anything besides 7 it will print the else if sentence.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If the wake-up time in part 3 is anything other than 7 or 8 it will print the sentence that they will go by car.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the number is exactly 0 then the program won't print anything as 0 is neither a positive or a negative number.</p>

      <li>1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!
        2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").
        3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.
        4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?
        5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)
        6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.
        7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.
        8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains.</li>
      <p>1. A data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable
        2.Hardcoding means putting fixed values directly into the source code of a program, essentialy making them "written in stone". This means they can't easily be changed without modifying the source code itself.
        3. The sentence is split up and each word becomes a different variable in the new array. We traverse it by looping the array using the length of it which is the number of words in the previous sentence.
        4. It's a good way to manage a collection of objects and allows for flexibility and access to them.
        5. We make a variable called "day" and link it to the eWeekDays variable and it's keys. Then we can call upon "day.value" to get the value of a a certain day.
        They differ from each other in that "Weekday" is 7 different days with different values and names, while "Workdays" and "Weekends" are just a combination of these 7 different days.
        "WorkoutDays" would look like this:
        WorkoutDays: {value: 0x01 + 0x03 + 0x04, name: "Treningsdager"}
        6. It compares two elements (a and b) at a time then sorts them in the order set (ascending, descending, or a custom order). After that it finds the next element to compare against and sorts them again. It will continue like this until it has sorted all the elements.
        7. In the methods I created it will sort the numbers in both ascending and descending order. Depending on which it is the code is different in the return part. (a - b) for ascending, (b -a) for descending.
        8. The first element of the array constaint a cell with the number 0,0. This is because it is row 0 and column 0.

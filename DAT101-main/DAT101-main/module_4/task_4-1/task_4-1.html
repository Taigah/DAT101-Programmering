      <li>1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?
        2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.
        3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.
        4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>1. Object-oriented development is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects and their interactions. It is widely regarded as a powerful methodology due to its ability to model real-world systems more effectively and its numerous benefits for managing complexity in large software projects.
        2. This object is used to create different types of bank accounts. This type of object can help us in software developments by making it easier to sort relevant data into different categories.
        3. Encapsulation is one of the core principles of OOP and is used to control how data and behaviour are accessed and modified within a class.
        By hiding code within a class we get better data integrity, more flexibility when changing the internal implementations of an object and it encourages the use of well-defined public methord to interact with the object.
        4. It creates a new empty object. The constructor function si called with "this" pointing to the new object and properties and methods are added to it. The new object is then returned unless the constructor returns another object.
